        <p data-width="wide">
          Component-based architecture is a framework for building software based on reusable parts. Each component contains well-defined functionality into a binary unit that is stored in a library and then dropped into an application without modifying other components.
          In HNG, I expect to work on developing and improving user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while collaborating closely with designers and backend developers. I’ll likely be involved in tasks such as implementing responsive designs, optimizing web performance, and fixing bugs to ensure a smooth user experience. Additionally, I may have opportunities to learn and use various frontend frameworks and tools like React, Vue, or Angular.

The most important part I look forward to is the mentorship and guidance I would get from seasoned frontend developers, that’s why I opted for the HNG Premium to get the most perks out of it
